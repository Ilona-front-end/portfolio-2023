# Portfolio

### Goal

Present skills I learned in the past three semesters.

### Brief

In this assignment, I am documenting three prior projects:

- Semester Project 2
- JavaScript Frameworks CA
- Project Exam 2

Added README.md file at the root of each of projects.

Added a README.md for my personal GitHub profile.

Lastly, I created a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects.

List of 3 projects presented as cards with:

- the title of the project
- a screenshot of how the project looks when running
- a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online
